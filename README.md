# Helper constructs for CDK

# Add to project
Use it by adding the following line to your `requirements.txt`:

```
git+https://github.com/aditrologistics/awscdk.git
```

You should always use a **virtual environment**.
```
python -m venv .env
```


## Dependencies
This package requires most of the aws packages. Hence they will be automatically included when you install this package.

# Usage

The constructs are available after specifying `import aws` in your python code.

Since this is a deployment only tool set, there is no need to deploy it with your lambda functions for instance.

# Documentation
The code is documented inline. Full documentation for all CDK constructs
